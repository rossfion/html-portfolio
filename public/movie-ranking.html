<h1>The Best Movies According to Fionn</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Matrix Trilogy</h3>
<p>In a dystopian world, humans defend themselves against the machines.</p> 

<p>Their only hope for salvation (or, at least, some peace) rests in the one called 'Neo'.</p>
<p>My favorite scene is when the machines break through Zion. It starts with a trickle and then a flood</p>

<p>I haven't watched the 4th instalment, so I can't comment on it.</p>

<h3>Chocolat</h3>
<p>A nomadic mother and daughter team arrive in a very conservative French village and set up a chocolate store - during Lent.</p>
<p>My favourite scene has to be the "Lord of the Manor" behaving like a pig wallowing in mud.</p>

<h3>Ghost in The Shell</h3>
<p>A cyborg federal agent is in pursuit of "The Puppet Master" who hacks into cyborg-human minds. At some point she begins  to ponder the question of her own identity.</p>
<p>The 2017 film was controversial as it appeared to be a case of whitewashing of Asian roles by Hollywood.</p>
<p>In the 1996 Japanese animation, Mira (the federal agent) is, of course, Japanese.</p>
<p>The song at the end of the 2017 movie by Kenji Kawai, a Bulgarian/Slavic (?) group of grannies and their daughters still sends chills up and down my spine!</p>
<p>I will have to see if I can find the anime. Perhaps on Crunchyroll?</p>
<hr />
<p>As an aside, I will watch anything from Studio Ghibli :-)</p>
<p>At the moment, I am catching up on anime created by the all-female CLAMP team. OK, so they're not movies...</p>
